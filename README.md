# Required plugins

Before creating any pages, you will need to go to Plugins > Add New > search for Classic Editor and install it, then activate it.

Click the settings in the plugin and ensure "Classic Editor" is set as the Default Editor for all users. 

# Theme setup
To get the theme running locally, you will need to set up different pages to display the Homepage and Posts page, in WP.

* Create two different pages in Wordpress - one called "Home" and another called "Blog"
* When creating the Home page, in Page Attributes, ensure you select "Front Page" as the template.
* Navigate to "Settings" > Reading and change "Your homepage displays" - set the Homepage to "Home" and the posts page to "Blog"
